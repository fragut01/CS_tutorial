# Compressed Sensing tutorial

##In this repository are available the Python and Matlab files to replicate the experiments from my Bachelor's thesis: "Compressed Sensing for seismic acquisition".

Additionally, csDockerfile is a dockerfile constructed with the dependencies needed to replicate the Python routines.

Also, you can find the PDF version of my thesis.

**IMPORTANT**: in order to get the files to work as expected, the paths to read the image and the SEGY file need to be changed to your own.
