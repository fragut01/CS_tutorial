# Compressed Sensing tutorial

> - In this repository are available the Python and Matlab files to replicate the experiments from my Bachelor's thesis: "Compressed Sensing for seismic acquisition".
>
> - Additionally, csDockerfile is a dockerfile constructed with the dependencies needed to replicate the Python routines. In order to build an image with it, you have to run the following command:
> ```
> docker build -f (path to csDockerfile) .
> ```
>
> - Also, you can find the PDF version of my thesis.
>
> **IMPORTANT**: in order to get the files to work as expected, the paths to read the image (LOLA.jpg) and the SEGY file (gob_20200731_synthetic_shot-gather.sgy) need to be changed to your own.
